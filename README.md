# rougeR
An implementation of the ROUGE package for the automatic evaluation of summaries.  My first actual package.  See the citation below for more information.

Currently supports the generation of ROUGE-N scores comparing one candidate to one reference summary.  Support for multiple references (using jackknifing, per below) and ROUGE-L, -W, and -S, are in development.
